	Father calls me William,
		  sister calls me Will,
	Mother calls me Willie,
		but the fellers call me Bill!
	Mighty glad I ain't a girl--
		ruther be a boy,
	Without them sashes, curls, an' things
		that's worn by Fauntleroy!
	Love to chawnk green apples
		an' go swimmin' in the lake--
	Hate to take the castor-ile
		they give for belly-ache!
	Most all the time, the whole year round,
		there ain't no flies on me,
	But jest 'fore Christmas
		I'm as good as I kin be!
